# follow up to do items.

## problems I've got now
- git updates in the folder it's in.  That shouldn't be the default behavior.  Default should just be to make the blog post. Only git upload when it's configured that way. 
- Tags are initially recommended and are good, but then get overwritten in after the draft is approved.  I'd like the default to keep those rec tags and categories. 
- missing by/author to each post
- the recommended title seriously sucks ass, I need to look at that post approval flow.
